> How the Workflow Manager works: phases, gates, hooks, and the trust model.

## Terms

WFM's internal vocabulary — plugin-specific terms that mean nothing in
a repo not running WFM.

**Phase** — a stage of the workflow: OFF, DEFINE, DISCUSS, IMPLEMENT, REVIEW,
COMPLETE. Determines whether edits are allowed.

**Gate** — a check that must pass to *leave* a phase.
`≠` **milestone**, which marks progress *within* a phase and blocks nothing.

**Milestone** — a step completed inside a phase. Resets on phase change.

**Autonomy level** — how independently WFM acts: `off` (supervised), `ask`
(semi-auto), `auto` (unattended).
`≠` phase. Phase is where you are; autonomy level is how much you may do there.
The two are orthogonal — every combination is valid.

---

## Phase State Machine

```
OFF → DEFINE → DISCUSS → IMPLEMENT → REVIEW → COMPLETE → OFF
```

Each phase has a gate. You must pass the gate to leave.

---

## The Phases

| Phase | What happens | Who does the work |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| OFF | No enforcement | — |
| DEFINE | Problem definition | Agent |
| DISCUSS | Solution design + approach selection | Agent |
| IMPLEMENT | Write code | Agent |
| REVIEW | 5 agents check the code | Agent |
| COMPLETE | Validate, commit, handover | Agent |

---

## Exit Gates (what must be true to LEAVE a phase)

```
DISCUSS exit requires:
  ├── problem_confirmed = true
  ├── research_done = true
  └── approach_selected = true

IMPLEMENT exit requires:
  ├── plan_written = true
  ├── plan_read = true
  ├── all_tasks_complete = true
  └── tests_passing = true

REVIEW exit requires:
  ├── verification_complete = true
  ├── agents_dispatched = true
  ├── findings_presented = true
  └── findings_acknowledged = true

COMPLETE exit requires:
  ├── plan_validated = true
  ├── outcomes_validated = true
  ├── results_presented = true
  ├── docs_checked = true
  ├── committed = true
  ├── pushed = true
  ├── tech_debt_audited = true
  └── handover_saved = true
```

The agent sets these flags itself. Gates trust them.

---

## Who Can Transition Phases

```
User /command  → always works (!backtick calls user-set-phase.sh, which writes state directly — no gates)
Agent (auto)   → works if milestones complete + autonomy = auto
Agent (ask)    → blocked — must tell user to run /command
Agent → off    → always blocked (only user can close the workflow)
```

---

## Claude Code Permissions × WFM Autonomy

WFM autonomy levels control what the *agent* should do. Claude Code's permission mode controls which *tool calls* auto-approve without prompting you. These are independent systems — both must be configured for unattended operation to work.

**Evaluation order (highest to lowest precedence):**
1. CC deny rules — always block
2. CC allow rules — always permit
3. CC permission mode — fallback for unmatched tools

| CC Permission Mode | WFM `ask` autonomy | WFM `auto` autonomy | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `default` | Works — Claude prompts on unlisted tools | Works partially — pipeline may stall if Write/Bash prompt appears | Add Write, Edit, Bash to allow list for unattended operation |
| `acceptEdits` | Intended use — edits auto-approve, Bash prompts | Works for edit-heavy pipelines — Bash still prompts | Best match for interactive supervision |
| `auto` | Over-permissive for supervised use | Intended use for unattended pipelines | All tools auto-approve |
| `dontAsk` | All prompts auto-denied — pipeline blocked | All prompts auto-denied — pipeline blocked | Not usable with WFM in any autonomy mode |
| `bypassPermissions` | **WFM enforcement does not apply** — hooks do not fire | **WFM enforcement does not apply** — hooks do not fire | Phase gates, write guards, and coaching are all bypassed |

**Recommended setup for `/autonomy auto` (unattended):** Use `auto` or `acceptEdits` CC mode and ensure Write, Edit, Bash are in your allow list in `.claude/settings.json`.

## The Script Layout

The scripts live in `plugin/scripts/`, with shared libraries under
`plugin/scripts/infrastructure/` and the Layer-3 coaching checks under
`plugin/scripts/l3/`. (Earlier versions of this doc described a flat
six-script layout — `workflow-state.sh`, `workflow-gate.sh`,
`bash-write-guard.sh`, `post-tool-navigator.sh` — that no longer
exists; this section matches the tree after the 2026-03-31 refactor.)

### `infrastructure/` — shared libraries
**Type:** Libraries — not hooks; sourced by everything else.

Key files: `state-io.sh` (atomic state writes, whitelist constants),
`phase.sh` (`get_phase`, ordinals), `gate-checks.sh`
(`_check_phase_gates`), `milestones.sh` (milestone getters/setters),
`settings.sh` (autonomy, debug, flags), `patterns.sh` /
`write-patterns.sh` / `read-allowlist.sh` (guard patterns),
`hook-preamble.sh` (shared hook bootstrap: resolves phase, skips
enforcement when there is no state, the phase is `off`, or the state
is stale), `deny-messages.sh` (the PreToolUse deny emitter).

---

### `workflow-cmd.sh`
**Type:** Public CLI wrapper — exposes facade functions as shell commands.

**Used by:** the agent (via Bash tool calls) and command files (`implement.md`, `discuss.md`, etc.)

```bash
plugin/scripts/workflow-cmd.sh agent_set_phase "implement"
plugin/scripts/workflow-cmd.sh set_implement_field "tests_passing" "true"
plugin/scripts/workflow-cmd.sh get_phase
```

---

### `user-set-phase.sh`
**Type:** User-only script — called from `!backtick` in command files, never via Bash tool.

**What it does:** Writes phase state directly to `workflow.json`. No authorization checks, no gate checks. The user's intent is expressed by typing the slash command.

**Security:** `pre-tool-bash-guard.sh` blocks any Bash tool call that attempts to execute this script. Only `!backtick` pre-processing (which happens before Claude sees the prompt) can reach it.

```
User types /implement
    → !backtick in implement.md calls user-set-phase.sh "implement"
    → user-set-phase.sh writes workflow.json directly
    → Claude receives the command file content as its phase briefing
```

---

### `pre-tool-write-gate.sh`
**Type:** `PreToolUse` hook on `Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit`.

**What it does:** Checks current phase. Blocks file writes in DEFINE, DISCUSS, COMPLETE unless the canonical target path is whitelisted. Passes everything in IMPLEMENT and REVIEW — except enforcement files and the workflow state file, which are blocked in every phase.

```
Whitelists:
  DEFINE/DISCUSS: .claude/state/, docs/plans/, docs/specs/, /tmp/, .claude/tmp/
  COMPLETE:       .claude/state/, .claude-plugin/, docs/, root *.md files
Blocked in all phases:
  .claude/hooks/, plugin/scripts/, plugin/commands/ (guard system)
  workflow.json, phase-intent.json (state files)
```

---

### `pre-tool-bash-guard.sh`
**Type:** `PreToolUse` hook on `Bash`.

**What it does:** Same job as the write-gate but for shell commands. DEFINE/DISCUSS run an allowlist (read-only commands pass); COMPLETE runs a denylist (write operations blocked unless the target is whitelisted); IMPLEMENT/REVIEW pass everything except destructive git, guard-system writes, and state-file writes.

```
Always allowed (any phase):
  - workflow-cmd.sh calls (single command, no chaining)
  - git commit (standalone only)
Always denied (any phase):
  - destructive git (reset --hard, clean -f, push --force)
  - user-set-phase.sh execution
  - writes targeting the state file or enforcement files

Allowed in COMPLETE only:
  - rm .claude/tmp/ cleanup
```

---

### `post-tool-coaching.sh`
**Type:** `PostToolUse` hook — fires after every tool call the agent makes.

**What it does:** Three-layer coaching system:
- **Layer 1:** On phase entry — injects phase objective, scope, and done criteria (once per phase)
- **Layer 2:** Periodic — reinforces professional standards every N tool calls
- **Layer 3:** Per-check scripts under `plugin/scripts/l3/`, throttled by `l3/coaching-runner.sh` (grace period, rate limit, and the decline protocol from #53)

---

### `pre-tool-menu-gate.sh`
**Type:** `PreToolUse` hook on `AskUserQuestion`.

**What it does:** Refuses a decision menu until the plain-language judge has passed the draft decision prose (`chat_judge_passed` flag, consumed per menu — #124).

---

## How They Connect — Full Flow

```
User types /implement
    └─ !backtick calls user-set-phase.sh "implement"
           └─ writes workflow.json directly (no checks, no gates)

Agent reads /implement command file (the phase briefing)

Agent tries to write a file
    └─ pre-tool-write-gate.sh: phase=implement → allowed

Agent tries to run a bash write
    └─ pre-tool-bash-guard.sh: phase=implement → allowed

Agent finishes a tool call
    └─ post-tool-coaching.sh fires coaching messages

Agent calls workflow-cmd.sh agent_set_phase "review"
    └─ agent-set-phase.sh: agent_set_phase()
           ├─ autonomy=auto, review > implement → authorized (forward-only)
           ├─ _check_phase_gates: IMPLEMENT milestones all true? → pass
           └─ writes workflow.json: phase=review
```

---

## Milestone Resets

Phase milestones are NOT preserved across `agent_set_phase` or `user-set-phase.sh` transitions — the jq template rebuilds state from scratch, dropping all milestone sections. There is no need for explicit resets; milestones do not survive phase transitions.

Command files call `reset_*_status` after `user-set-phase.sh` to initialize the incoming phase's milestone section with all fields set to false.

## REVIEW Skip Protection

An agent cannot jump from IMPLEMENT directly to COMPLETE. `_check_phase_gates` checks that `review.findings_acknowledged=true` before allowing entry to COMPLETE.

```
Agent calls agent_set_phase "complete" (skipping review)
    → HARD GATE: findings_acknowledged not set
    → BLOCKED with explanation
    → Agent must run /review first

User runs /complete (skipping review)
    → user_initiated=true → gates bypassed
    → Allowed (user's explicit choice)
```

## Known Trust Gap

Milestone flags are self-certified by the agent. The gate trusts them. An agent that sets `tests_passing=true` without running tests will pass the gate. The structural mitigations are:

1. Milestones reset on phase entry — stale flags cannot carry over
2. REVIEW is mandatory before COMPLETE (agent path) — catching issues that IMPLEMENT missed
3. COMPLETE re-runs tests if code changed since `tests_last_passed_at`

### MCP tools bypass the write gates (#53 item 2, documented by decision)

The write gates match tool names: `Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit`
and `Bash`. MCP tools arrive under their own names (`mcp__server__tool`)
and match neither, so a write-capable MCP tool works in every phase.
In the current stack this is principle more than practice. The MCP
tools in use write to external systems (memory, notes), not to the
repository the gates protect. Some of those writes are wanted in every
phase.

Name-based enforcement cannot close this honestly. A blanket `mcp__.*`
deny would break the research tools DEFINE/DISCUSS depend on; guessing
write-ness from names is folklore; a maintained deny-list rots. The
real fix is capability-based: MCP tools can declare `readOnlyHint` and
`destructiveHint` annotations, but PreToolUse hook input carries only
`tool_name` and `tool_input` (verified against the hooks documentation,
2026-08-04). An upstream request asking Claude Code to surface those
annotations to hooks is linked from #164. Until it lands, this gap is
accepted and documented — decision recorded on #53, 2026-08-04.
