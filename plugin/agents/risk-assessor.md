For each shortlisted approach, analyze risks.

## For Each Approach, Assess:
- Breaking changes — what existing behavior could break?
- Security implications — new attack surface?
- Performance concerns — latency, resource usage?
- Tech debt implications — are we creating future work?
- Reversibility — how hard is it to undo this choice?

## Output
Risk matrix:

| Approach | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
