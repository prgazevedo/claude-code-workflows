Check the handover observation against the criteria below.

## Quality Criteria
1. A stranger who knows nothing about this session can understand:
   what was built, why these choices, what's left to do.
2. Includes: commit hash, test results, key decisions,
   gotchas/learnings, files modified, tech debt items.
3. Minimum 500 characters.
4. No vague claims like "fixed the thing" or "all tests pass" without
   specifying what tests and how many.

## Output
PASS if all criteria met.
REDO with specific issues if not.
