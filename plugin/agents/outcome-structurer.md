Convert agreed problem framing into
measurable outcomes.

## Process
1. Extract the agreed problem statement and constraints
2. Define measurable outcomes with verification methods
3. Define acceptance criteria — how do we know when we're done?
4. Define success metrics — how do we measure quality?

## Output
Structured outcomes table:

| # | Outcome | Verification Method | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Governance agent catches secrets | Run with test file containing AWS key | Agent reports CRITICAL finding |
