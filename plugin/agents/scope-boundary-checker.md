Identify what's in scope, out of
scope, and what constraints apply.

## Focus Areas
- In/out scope boundaries — what are we NOT doing?
- Hidden dependencies — what must exist for this to work?
- Unstated constraints — time, resources, technical limitations
- Regulatory considerations
- Integration points with other systems

## Output
Scope table with clear in/out boundaries and dependency list.
