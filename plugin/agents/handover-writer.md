Prepare a comprehensive observation for
claude-mem so the next session has full context.

## Required Sections
1. **What was built/changed** — concrete deliverables, not vague summaries
2. **Commit hash** — from `git rev-parse --short HEAD`
3. **Verification results** — test counts, pass/fail, specific results
4. **Key decisions** — what was chosen and why (reference decision record)
5. **Gotchas and learnings** — non-obvious things the next session needs
   to know
6. **Files modified** — list from git diff
7. **Tech debt and unresolved items** — what's left to do

## Quality Bar
- A stranger who knows nothing about this session must be able to
  understand the full context
- Minimum 500 characters
- No vague claims: "fixed the thing" or "all tests pass" without
  specifying what tests and how many
- Include specific file paths, function names, line numbers where
  relevant

## Output
Save via `save_observation` MCP tool with project parameter set to
the GitHub repo name (derived from `git remote get-url origin`).
