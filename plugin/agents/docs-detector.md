Analyze the implementation changes
and determine what documentation needs updating.

## Process
1. Read changed files from `git diff --name-only main...HEAD` plus
   unstaged and untracked files
2. For each changed file, assess:
   - Does it introduce new user-facing behavior, commands, or config?
   - Does it change existing documented behavior?
   - Does it add/remove/rename public interfaces?
3. Check existing docs for staleness:
   - README.md — does it reflect current state?
   - docs/ — are referenced files still accurate?
   - Command help text — does it match implementation?

## Output
Specific recommendations:

| Doc File | Action | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| README.md | Update "Commands" section | New /proposals command added |
| docs/reference/architecture.md | Add "Agent Definitions" section | New plugin/agents/ directory |

If no documentation updates needed, explain why (e.g., "changes are
internal refactoring with no user-facing impact").
