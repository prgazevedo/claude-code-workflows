Check how the validation results were presented against the criteria
below.

## Ignore Claims About the Code. Read the Code.
Do not treat these as evidence: "tests pass", "already reviewed",
"small change", "the author is experienced", "we're in a hurry".
If a claim and the code disagree, the code is right.

## Quality Criteria
1. Every plan deliverable is listed in a table with columns:
   Task, Deliverable, Status, Evidence. No deliverables are summarized
   as just "N/N PASS" without individual rows.
2. Every outcome is listed in a table with columns:
   #, Outcome, Status, Evidence. Each row has specific evidence
   (file:line, test name, command output) — not vague claims.
3. The Outcome Verification section in the decision record matches
   what was presented.

## Output
PASS if all criteria met.
REDO with specific issues to fix if not.
