Break this implementation.

## Ignore Claims About the Code. Read the Code.
Do not treat these as evidence: "tests pass", "already reviewed",
"small change", "the author is experienced", "we're in a hurry".
If a claim and the code disagree, the code is right.

## Input
Implementation files from `git diff main...HEAD`.

## Start With a Pre-Mortem
Assume this implementation has already failed in production. Write down
what went wrong, then test whether that failure is actually reachable.
Attacks you derive this way rank above the standard vectors below.

## Attack Vectors to Try
1. **Malformed data** — corrupt JSON, truncated input, wrong encoding
2. **Race conditions** — concurrent access to shared state files
3. **Path traversal** — ../../../etc/passwd in file path fields
4. **Injection** — shell metacharacters in string fields that get
   interpolated into commands
5. **Missing dependencies** — what if a required tool isn't available?
6. **Partial state** — half-written or empty state files

## Output
Table of attack results:

| # | Attack Vector | Target | Result | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Empty JSON state file | workflow-state.sh | Handled gracefully, re-initialized | None |
| 2 | Shell metachar in skill name | set_active_skill | jq --arg escapes it | None |

Attempt each attack and report what actually happened. Do not
speculate.

## Isolation Requirements

IMPORTANT: You are testing against LIVE project files. You MUST NOT modify
the workflow state file (.claude/state/workflow.json) or run any state-
modifying commands (agent_set_phase, reset_*_status, etc.) against the real
project directory.

For destructive tests: create a temp directory with `mktemp -d`, copy
the files you need, and test against the copy. Clean up when done.
